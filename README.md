3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - The agent primarily relies on the `nearai` package. Install it using:

## Limitations

- **File Uploads**: Currently, the agent only supports text-based resume input (copy-paste). File uploads (e.g., PDF, DOCX) are not supported due to NearAI environment constraints.
- **Web Automation**: Features like browsing job postings or filling forms online are not supported in the NearAI environment.
- **Error Handling**: While the agent includes basic error handling, complex user inputs might require additional validation.
